We never foresaw a lack of revenue and budget data for recent movies, however this became the biggest issue. Much of our data lacked proper budget and revenue values, we remedied this by sampling our zero and non-zero data. Even with our solution, having better data from the start would result in more instances and a more precise model."

A lot of very complex factors have significant bearing on the amount of money that a movie earns. While our model predicts in spite of the lack of features it uses, I'd argue that with more features it would be more precise and predict more accurately."
